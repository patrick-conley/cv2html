<p><p><strong><em>Work experience</em></strong>
<p>2013 (2 terms)<br>
<strong>Co-op software developer</strong>
<em></br>
 Seeker Solutions</em>,
Victoria, BC

</br><ul><li> Designed and built an Android lifelogging app (Java) which relied
         on ML clustering of GPS data rather than web services to
         identify types of places visited.
      
<li> Reduced battery impact of data analysis by analysing and collating
         data asynchronously through a RESTful server.
      
<li> Optimized the algorithm we used for data reduction (DBSCAN) to run
         in <em>O(n)</em>, not <em>O(n^(2))</em>, on our data format.
      
<li> Built an Eclipse plugin (Java) which automatically identified and
         generated tedious unit tests (e.g. for field accessors) by
         na&iuml;ve Bayes classification of code.
      
<li> Ran some sprint planning meetings and scrums in my second term.
      
<li> Mentored novice teammates; pair programmed with novice &amp;
         experienced teammates.

<p>2010 (1 term)<br>
<strong>Research assistant (co-op)</strong>
<em></br>
 Department of Fisheries and Oceans&#8212;Institute of Ocean Science</em>,
Victoria, BC

</br><ul><li> Built an IDL to Matlab recursive descent transcompiler (Perl) to
         help me translate &amp; reimplement legacy code.
      
<li> Performed Monte-Carlo simulations (Matlab) studying the effects of
         long-period tides and waves on measurements of sea level rise.

<p>2008&#8211;2009 (3 terms)<br>
<strong>Research technician (co-op)</strong>
<em></br>
 UVic/TRIUMF</em>,
Victoria, BC; Hamburg, Germany

</br><ul><li> Tested, built, and troubleshot a prototype calibration system for
         a central detector of the International Linear Collider.
      
<li> Wrote analysis code (C++) for data obtained from the calibration
         system via the detector's readout electronics.
      
<li> Reimplemented the existing reconstruction chain to deal with
         novel problems introduced by the nature of the calibration system.
      
<li> Gained speaking experience:
         
<ul><li> Presented progress reports to the detector working group at
               regular meetings;
            
<li> Gave talks on my project to students at a detector design
               workshop and to colleagues in the lepton collider research
               department at DESY;
            
<li> Prepared and presented a poster on the group's work at an
               international conference.

<p><p><strong><em>Projects</em></strong>
<p><strong>Android music player</strong><br>

   Music player app. designed for classical music &amp; jazz, where conventional
   artist/album/title tags aren't sufficient.
   <ul><li> Personal project, in progress: Java/Android.
      
<li> Store any tags allowed by ID3v2 (<em>~70</em> metadata keys) and
         Vorbis Comments (<em>~256^(2^(32))</em> possible keys) using an
         unconventional but simple database schema.
      
<li> Find music matching any set of tags with a configurable tree of
         filters (no reliance on text search).

<p><strong>Finding minimum dominating sets</strong><br>

   Recursive backtracking algorithm to find exact solutions to the minimum
   dominating set problem on various classes of graphs.
   <ul><li> Course project: C language.
      
<li> Explored branch &amp; bound and kernelization techniques to find
         solutions as quickly as possible.
      
<li> By exploiting greedy vertex-selection criteria, my implementation
         ran <em>10x</em> faster on large, dense graphs (e.g., Queen graphs,
         Kneser graphs) than other students'.
